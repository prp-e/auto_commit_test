# Testing `GitPython` automation 

Nothing fancy, just a weird repo for testing automation capabilities of python on github repos.

## Changelog

- Proof of concept worked
- All old files removed 
- Testing with new commit style and file names

## One request 

Do not post this as an "Internet mystery" on reddit, it is just a weird test I performed and nothing more. No strange activity. Files generated randomly and filled with random big numbers just to be worthy of commiting on the repo.
